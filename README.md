# Soham's dotfiles   
Here are my dotfiles, they are super minimal and pretty basic. They are all I need.  

# Install   
### Symlinks  

```
git clone git://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./makesymlinks.sh
```

### Homebrew stuff  
Homebrew basically lets you install Mac apps without having to do it manually.  
```
cd dotfiles
brew tap homebrew/bundle
brew bundle  
```  

### Credits 
Thanks to [Michael](https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles), without his article I would have never figured out dotfiles.
